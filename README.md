# **LineFollower_ObstacleDetection**

The **Line Follower with Obstacle Detection** is a robotic system designed to autonomously follow a pre-defined path (line) and detect obstacles in its path using sensors. The robot halts upon detecting an obstacle and resumes operation once the path is clear. This project integrates line-following capabilities and obstacle avoidance to create a versatile and efficient robotic system suitable for automation tasks, logistics, and smart industrial applications.
